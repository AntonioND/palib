# Welcome to PAlib but for modern stuff

yeah, this PAlib fork has the two fixes of mdPAlib, making it work on modern devkitARM. now i am not sure about compiling the library,
i do not think that will end up well but hey if mdpalib compiles then this can.

# Installation

Just download this and put it in into the devkitPro folder.

# Stuff working

So far everything except ARM7 cores. (shit that is not PAlib anyways.)
